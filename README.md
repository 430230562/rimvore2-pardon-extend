This is the repository for **RimVore2 pardon's Extend (PRV2E)** — a sub-mod of RimVore2.

中文版简介[CN_README.md](CN_README.md)

## 🔥 Main Features

- Adds several **genes related to vore**, including lines for capacity, mobility, digestion strength, anti-digestion strength, etc. (Does not yet cover all Quirks.)
- Changes the **nutrition value of transformation products** and allows them to be further processed into food or **neutral amine**.
- Makes some **vanilla traits affect grappling chance and grappling power**.
- Alters the **Reform process mechanics** — now influenced by digestion strength and anti-digestion strength.
- Allows **temporary storage, safekeeping, and entertainment in the uterus** to reduce prey age and cure age-related illnesses.
- Overhauls the **Heal mechanism**, greatly increasing treatment speed.
- Adds **new vore pathways**.
- Miscellaneous tweaks:
  - Soil fertility of rich soil
  - Re-categorization of vore-enhancing devices

## ⚠️ Issues

- Obviously, this mod **greatly reduces game difficulty**. Not necessarily a critical issue, but worth noting.
- **Gene metabolism rates are not well balanced** and might even involve some self-referential design. If you have suggestions for balance, feel free to propose them.
- **I really can't make sprites.** 😭 If someone is willing to help create gene icons, I would be immensely grateful.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- I'm considering a vore pathway that converts pawns into **cloth**, but haven't found a suitable organ to associate it with yet…
